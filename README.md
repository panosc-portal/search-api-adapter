# search-api-adapter
## Documentation is TBD asap
 - working sample hosted here: http://pan-dev-portal.eli-laser.eu/
   - The list of filterables which the adapter uses is not really compatible with the target Search API instance (ESS's federated endpoint), it will be updated once I get my hands on it (the federated instance doesn't return anything on it's /Parameters, /Paramterers/statistics or /Techniques endpoints, so I cannot manually curate one.)
